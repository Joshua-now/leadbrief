I need a true end-to-end acceptance pass like a human using the app. Do NOT rely on unit tests alone. Pretend you’re a QA tester using the Railway deployment in a browser and via curl.
Do not say “done” unless every check below passes and you paste proof outputs.

A) Environment + Health (Railway)

Hit /api/health and paste output

Hit /api/ready and paste output

Hit /api/finalcheck and paste output

B) Security (Inbound Intake)

POST /api/intake without X-API-Key → must return 401 (paste curl + response)

POST /api/intake with correct X-API-Key → must return 200 success (paste curl + response)

C) Data Model Completeness (must exist + visible in UI)

The app must support and display these first-class fields for contacts/leads:

business/company name

website URL + derived domain

city + state (and address optional)

category/industry optional

email + phone

Confirm these fields exist in DB schema (paste migration/SQL or schema snippet).

Confirm the Contacts list UI shows business name, website, city/state (not “Unknown”) for test records.

D) Import / Mapping UI (user workflow)

In the Import UI, confirm mapping targets exist for:

Business Name

Website URL

City

State
(Paste screenshot or describe exact UI labels + where they appear.)

E) End-to-End “Pretend User” Walkthrough (UI)

Perform this walkthrough on the Railway deployment as if you’re a user:
9) Add/import a small CSV with 3 test leads:

Lead 1: phone + city/state + website + business name (no email)

Lead 2: email + business name + website (no phone)

Lead 3: phone only (minimal)

Verify they appear in Contacts and each shows correct fields.

Verify Data Quality differs per lead (not all 20%) and includes Website as a dimension.

F) De-dup / Merge / Upsert (critical)

Import the SAME CSV again. The system must MERGE not duplicate:

Contact count must NOT increase for matching leads.

Existing contact should be updated with missing fields if provided.

Paste proof:

before/after counts OR query output OR screenshot showing no duplicates

show one example contact that got enriched (fields added) rather than duplicated

Matching rules required:

email (case-insensitive) highest priority

else domain/website

else phone normalized

never overwrite good data with blanks

G) Contacts List Scrolling (UI usability)

Populate at least 60 contacts (can be generated test records) and confirm:

you can scroll to the last row at 100% browser zoom

header remains usable
Paste proof (short screen recording description or screenshot notes) and confirm overflow-hidden is not blocking scrolling.

H) Logging + Diagnostics

Trigger one expected failure (e.g., save settings POST if still exists or bad intake key) and confirm logs show helpful error context (paste log snippet).

I) Final Report (required)

Provide a checklist with PASS/FAIL for each item above, plus:

files changed

migrations/SQL applied

exact commands/curls run

anything still not covered

Do not mark complete unless ALL items pass with pasted proof from the Railway deployment.

Optional “make it even harder”

Add this one line at the end if you want maximum strictness:

If any item fails, stop and fix it immediately, then rerun the entire checklist and paste fresh proofs.
