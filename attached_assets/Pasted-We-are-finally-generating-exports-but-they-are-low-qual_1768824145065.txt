We are finally generating exports, but they are low quality and repetitive. Please improve the report/export pipeline so output is “clean and useful,” not filler.

Problems:

personalization bullets are generic and identical across all rows (“Based in Orlando… professional services”)

website/category/services/email/title are mostly empty

confidence_score appears hard-coded at 0.25

duplicates exist (same company_name/city multiple times)

Required fixes:

Deduplicate leads before export using: phone_norm > domain_norm > (company_name_norm + city). Export one canonical row and optionally mark duplicates.

Implement report quality tiers:

Tier 0 (only name/city/phone): do NOT generate fake bullets; leave bullets blank or “needs enrichment”

Tier 1 (has website/domain): generate bullets from page title/meta/H1 + detected service keywords

Tier 2 (has website + enrichment): generate strong bullets + icebreaker

Replace generic bullets with computed bullets derived from real fields (services/category/reviews/keywords). If no signal exists, do not invent it.

Make confidence_score computed from available signals (name/website/services/sources). Include confidence rationale that reflects actual data.

Ensure scrape_url, scrape_status, and scrape_sources are populated for each row when scraping runs.

Update the “icebreaker” to reference at least one real signal (service, keyword, review, USP). If none, leave it blank instead of generic.

Acceptance criteria:

No repeated filler bullets across different companies

Duplicates removed/marked

Confidence varies based on data present

Exports are human-usable for outreach

One more thing (important)

If you want “clean reports,” you need one enrichment step that reliably finds a website/domain.

Even a simple “domain guess + verify” step will transform output quality:

try company_name + city search → get top domain

store it

scrape that domain for keywords/services

Once websites fill in, your reports will instantly stop looking generic.
