Import works but it’s only saving partial fields (email/phone). We’re missing critical fields: business name, website URL, city, state, address, category — and “Website URL” isn’t even listed in the Data Quality panel, meaning the model/UI doesn’t support it or it’s not being populated.

Goal: After import, each contact must show business name + website + city/state at minimum, and Data Quality must reflect “website” as a tracked dimension.

1) Diagnose exactly where fields are being lost

Confirm what the import payload contains (CSV columns or API intake JSON). Log one sanitized example row.

Trace mapping through: import parser → normalization → DB insert → API response → UI display.

2) Fix normalization + mapping (must handle common lead sources)

Add a single canonical normalization layer that supports these aliases (examples):

business name: company, company_name, business_name, name, place_name

website: website, website_url, domain, site

location: city, state, address, formatted_address

category: category, type, primary_category

phone: phone, phone_number

email: email, emails[]

Ensure BOTH flows are correct:

CSV import mapping → normalized lead

POST /api/intake → normalized lead

3) Update DB schema + API + UI to support these fields

Add missing columns if needed (contacts table or related tables): company_name, website, domain, city, state, address, category

Ensure GET contacts returns these fields and UI renders them.

4) Fix Data Quality calculation + UI dimensions

Data Quality panel must include and compute: website, company_name, location (city/state), email, phone, linkedin, title

Scoring must not default everything to the same % when fields exist.

5) Provide proof from Railway deployment (required)

After deploy, paste:

A sample imported contact JSON showing business_name + website + city/state populated

Screenshot/text of Data Quality panel showing “Website” dimension present and non-zero for that contact

/api/finalcheck still passing

A one-time “import self-test” endpoint or script that imports 3 sample leads with different completeness and shows different quality scores.

Do not mark complete until imported leads display business name, website URL, and city/state in Contacts and Data Quality includes Website.
